# SmartChef

## Bachelor Degree Project

A web application that integrates two YOLOv8-based ingredient recognition models, allowing users to upload photos of ingredients, which are then automatically detected and used to suggest relevant recipes via the Spoonacular API.

The platform is developed using Angular for frontend and .NET for backend with a SQL Server database used to store user data.
